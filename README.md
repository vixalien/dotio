# vixalien.io

vixalien.io is my personal site, built with [react], compiled with [rollup] and hosted on [vercel], but most importantly, built from scratch.

## links

source: [github]

web: [click]

## installation

Because vixalien.io is a custom-made site, running is a little bit different but very easy

```bash
npm run deploy
```

This will install all required modules and also build files.

```bash
npm run start
```

The site will go live at [localhost].
